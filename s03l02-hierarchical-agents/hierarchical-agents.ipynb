      "Abstract\n",
      "The influence of artificial intelligence (AI) has drastically risen in recent years, especially in the field of medicine. Its influence has spread so greatly that it is determined to become a pillar in the future medical world. A comprehensive literature search related to AI in healthcare was performed in the PubMed database and retrieved the relevant information from suitable ones. AI excels in aspects such as rapid adaptation, high diagnostic accuracy, and data management that can help improve workforce productivity. With this potential in sight, the FDA has continuously approved more machine learning (ML) software to be used by medical workers and scientists. However, there are few controversies such as increased chances of data breaches, concern for clinical implementation, and potential healthcare dilemmas. In this article, the positive and negative aspects of AI implementation in healthcare are discussed, as well as recommended some potential solutions to the potential issues at hand.\n",
      "Keywords: Artificial intelligence, machine learning, healthcare, health services, drug design, public health Background\n",
      "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the programing of computer systems to analyze, problem-solve, and make decisions just as a human would.\n",
      "1\n",
      "AI was first introduced in the 1950s with many limitations which made it difficult to be introduced into healthcare but has since developed into what we use today in modern medicine.\n",
      "2\n",
      "AI began as a simple system series that analyzed “if this, then this. . . rules” used broadly to advancement into algorithms personalized individually.\n",
      "2\n",
      "Early AI in medicine from the 1950s to 1970s has not received much attention and has a lack of acceptance by the scientific communities.\n",
      "2\n",
      "This period was more focused on the ability to digitize all data into electronic medical record systems and clinical informatics databases. As well as aid in the development of today’s search engines, such as PubMed.\n",
      "3\n",
      "The mid-1970s began the flourishment of biomedical search engines, expanding into universities such as Rutgers and Stanford.\n",
      "2\n",
      "This created an enhanced networking system for collaboration between several universities for research, later resulting in the first National Institutes of Health (NIH) workshop-the start of collaboration events of the future.\n",
      "2\n",
      "The first of many prototypes of how AI in medicine could positively impact the future started in the late 70s with the introduction of the consultation program Causal-Associational Network (CASNET).\n",
      "2\n",
      "The program could use disease data, apply it to an individual, and give advice to the physician on how to help the patient manage the disease.\n",
      "2\n",
      "Later, a bacterial pathogen and antibiotic treatment diagnostic AI developed from MYCIN to EMYCIN to INTERNIST-1 in just a few years.\n",
      "2\n",
      "The evolution of this system elaborated on the already extensive AI medical knowledge to help assist primary care physicians (PCPs).\n",
      "2\n",
      "The AI program that prompted the most influence of AI in medicine was introduced in 1986-DXplain.\n",
      "2\n",
      "PCPs were able to input their patient’s symptoms, and the program responded with a diagnosis, along with a description of the disease and additional references for the physicians.\n",
      "2\n",
      "The program started with 500 diseases and has now expanded to over 2400.\n",
      "2\n",
      "The early 2000s introduced Watson, an open-domain question-answering system.\n",
      "2\n",
      "This system used the electronic medical record with other electronic resources to provide physicians with evidence-based solutions to their patients’ questions.\n",
      "2\n",
      "Watson was later expanded upon for the exploration of medical research into new areas. Thus, beginning the expansion of AI into other areas such as pharmacy and patient intake at primary care practices.\n",
      "2\n",
      "Advancements in AI programs have been happening since it was first introduced in the 1950s.\n",
      "2\n",
      "The use of them has had a positive impact on the quality of medicine improving accuracy, consistency, and efficiency in all aspects. AI in medicine has evolved over the last 5 decades into personalized diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventative care. In this article, it is discussed how artificial intelligence can positively impact the future of medicine, along with its downsides. Methodology\n",
      "A comprehensive literature (Scopus indexed and Web of Science) search related to AI in healthcare, like AI background, and its positive and negative impacts on health settings, drug design, and development, disease screening, and treatment was performed in the PubMed database and extracted the relevant information from appropriate ones. Literature written only in English was selected for this review. The literature discussed the impacts of AI in other industries like automotive, robots, business, banking, etc. was excluded from our considerations. Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare Services\n",
      "AI is used daily in many areas of modern healthcare, from the online scheduling service for appointments to drug interaction warnings when physicians prescribe multiple medications to research development.\n",
      "4\n",
      "The most widely known and accepted evidence-based medicine used today are flowcharts and database research. A physician will take the patient’s history, current symptoms, and lab results to determine the proper diagnosis and give the appropriate treatment plan. An AI system will do this same process, in a fraction amount of time and have greater accuracy because it can tap into multiple databases at once.\n",
      "4\n",
      "This is only a small area in which AI has tapped into modern medicine.\n",
      "Other areas of medicine that have embraced AI include medical imaging, gastroenterology, surgery, and online consultations and therapy. Radiology has taken the largest leap into AI technology with its first use in image acquisition and storage, to now the use of computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD).\n",
      "3\n",
      "AI is on its way to helping to decrease the workload on radiologists with quick identification of negative exams and heightened turn-around time for abnormal ones.\n",
      "5\n",
      "In 2017, Arterys was the first FDA-approved deep learning application of AI in healthcare.\n",
      "2\n",
      "Deep learning (DL) can be used to detect lesions, compose reports, and create differential diagnoses.\n",
      "3\n",
      "The first product could analyze cardiac magnetic resonance images in seconds to measure ejection fraction, and since has evolved to liver, lung, chest, and musculoskeletal imaging, and non-contrast CAT scans.\n",
      "2\n",
      "DL has since expanded more, with the ability to screen diabetic retinopathy, identification of melanoma and nonmelanoma, prevention of cardiovascular risk, and prediction of Alzheimer’s disease progression by analysis of amyloid data.\n",
      "2\n",
      "The development of AI has helped in CAD in gastroenterology also. AI can be applied to colonoscopies to help in the identification and verification of benign versus malignant colon polyps.\n",
      "2\n",
      "With the use of the same AI technology, it has been used to differentiate between pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer – something once considered a challenge to determine.\n",
      "2\n",
      "On the other side, AI assistance has also been crucial for endoscopies. The AI CAD system has been deemed beneficial for the differentiation between adenomas and polyps, the improvement of imaging, and the development of prediction models for patient prognoses and treatment.\n",
      "2\n",
      "The use of AI for diagnostic procedures has since developed into aiding in surgical ones. Robotic arms are the way of the future for surgeries, starting in the fields of urology and gynecology. The robotic arms are set to mimic the surgeon’s hands but with more precise movements and better magnification.\n",
      "3\n",
      "The practice of AI within the PCP office to care for patients is rapidly turning into online consultations, advice visits, medication refills, orders of test kits, and much more. A patient can request a consultation with a specific physician based on how they fill out their questionnaire before the visit.\n",
      "3\n",
      "This questionnaire will answer the basic questions of past medical history and current symptoms, from that the AI will generate what the physician should order and treatment options.\n",
      "3\n",
      "The AI technology for PCP visits is slowly expanding into therapy facilities as well. AI therapy offers an online course for patients to use to help in the treatment of their diagnosis.\n",
      "3\n",
      "All the advancements of AI in medicine have come a long way, but there is always room for improvement and expansion. Artificial Intelligence in Drug Design and Development\n",
      "Recent studies have also found AI to be useful in reducing time and costs in pharmaceutical technology and drug delivery design.\n",
      "6\n",
      "More specifically, machine learning (ML: for forecasting drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) and deep learning (DL: for predicting various pharmacokinetic parameters, such as drug absorption, bioavailability, clearance, volume of distribution, and half-life) algorithms can predict the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of potential drug candidates. 6 , 7 This can drastically reduce the need and purchase of animals for testing and similarly save time. Large companies such as Pfizer, Bayer, and Roche have announced that AI can help use data to make faster decisions and allow them to develop therapies in immune-oncology and cardiovascular diseases. 8 , 9 More specifically, AI may help in choosing which medications not to pursue, potentially mitigating the chances of a poor decision, and reducing the R&D cost.\n",
      "8\n",
      "In related cases, AI is being adopted in pharmacometrics to aid in describing non-linear relationships using ML-based techniques.\n",
      "10\n",
      "Although it is currently only in the simulation phase, the experimental results demonstrated that the trained network “was able to correctly predict the treatment effects across a certain range of dose levels.”\n",
      "10\n",
      "In other words, the ML system was able to prescribe correct treatments up to a certain dosage. This shows the potential of AI in not only clinical cases but also in other fields of medicine. Positive Aspects of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare\n",
      "AI has a variety of positive aspects related to its application in healthcare. Currently, it is primarily used in the diagnosis of cancer, neurological diseases, and cardiovascular diseases.\n",
      "11\n",
      "Early detection of NCP plays an important role in transmission prevention and positive outcomes in treatment.\n",
      "12\n",
      "Additionally, in the diagnosis of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) V600E mutation in colorectal carcinomas, the AI model used presented a 93.8% diagnostic accuracy.\n",
      "13\n",
      "From these results, it is shown that AI models could be what physicians need to confidently advance with a treatment plan. Likewise, AI models would greatly improve the volume of patient’s physicians can move through. This added speed would decrease the time patients wait for a diagnosis, as well as expediting the diagnosis to the treatment period. Let alone work for physicians, AI can also provide tremendous care in regulatory requirements and redundant paperwork for nurses.\n",
      "14\n",
      "These redundant but necessary parts of a nurse’s job require about 25% of their time on shift, which can be used more efficiently by being alongside a patient.\n",
      "13\n",
      "Another advantage of AI in the healthcare world is rapid adaptation. The timeline for reporting a new foodborne illness in foodborne outbreaks is about 3 to 4 weeks according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n",
      "15\n",
      "An AI system could identify an uncommon set of symptoms or bacterial strains much faster than a physician or laboratory. Which, for new diseases or outbreaks, could be the difference between a containable epidemic, or an uncontrolled pandemic. Evidence of such potential is shown in a study by the University of Oxford, in which AI identified viruses by analyzing their fluorescent labels. As a result, strains of respiratory viruses such as the flu and Covid-19 were identified with >97% accuracy within 5 minutes.\n",
      "16\n",
      "Regarding the diagnosis of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), a team of researchers developed an AI system that accurately diagnosed NCP with 92.49% accuracy, 94.93% sensitivity, and 91.13% specificity.\n",
      "17\n",
      "This point is apparent in the light of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Perhaps, with the availability and assistance of this technology, the impact of the Covid-19 crisis could have been mitigated. Negative Impacts of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare\n",
      "The debate about incorporating AI into healthcare has raised controversy in the workforce. With the intent to make AI a fundamental pillar in healthcare, several drawbacks and difficulties have been put into consideration. Difficulties such as relevant data accessibility, concern for clinical implementation, and ethical dilemmas between AI and patients.\n",
      "In an analysis of current AI capabilities, it can be argued that the negatives outweigh the positives. The most popular AI platform ChatGPT, has been proven a lack of authenticity regarding references used in medical articles.\n",
      "18\n",
      "The ChatGPT generated 30 short medical papers, each with at least 3 references, and a worse outcome has been found. Overall, 115 references in those medical articles, 47% were fabricated, 46% were authentic but inaccurate, and only 7% of them were authentic and accurately analyzed the information.\n",
      "18\n",
      "In response to this, it is very difficult to justify using AI in the medical world provided its current accuracy.\n",
      "The major ethical concern with AI in health services stems from the common use of electronic health records and their preferential targeting in data breaches. 19 , 20 These electronic health records, if filled out by a comprehensive AI, could contain more sensitive information about a patient than if it was filled by a healthcare professional. This comprehensive AI could be taking quantitative data, and extrapolating it into a probability of health risks and concerns, which would give greater detail into a patient’s medical history to bad actors wanting to sell this information and raise serious privacy concerns.\n",
      "21\n",
      "Beyond privacy, the accountability for the misdiagnosis of an AI is also of issue. AIs are touted as more accurate than physicians in their diagnosis, one study found that AI involved in the diagnosis of arrhythmias had an average F1 score of 0.84 compared to the average cardiologist score, of 0.78.\n",
      "22\n",
      "In the instance of a cardiologist defaulting to this AI in their diagnosis when they are uncertain, they would be making the best choice they could make in that instant, but if the AI misdiagnoses this patient, and creates a worse situation, it is hard to pin the blame on the cardiologist.\n",
      "22\n",
      "In addition, legal action regarding the error will be very difficult to execute because artificial intelligence cannot be held accountable as a real person would. These issues need to be cleared before AI can be implemented in any impactful way in the diagnosis of serious health conditions. To overcome these obstacles, several approaches like developing ethical governance, model explainability, model interpretability, and ethical auditing possible solutions have been recommended to maximize fairness, accountability, and transparency.\n",
      "23\n",
      "AI needs a larger quantity of data and relevant data accessibility to operate its functions. 24 , 25 For ML, a process that allows AI to learn without direct instruction to work efficiently, it would need a large quantity of data sets. 25 , 26 As such, if healthcare providers wanted AI to learn relevant patient data and learn how to manage healthcare databases, the AI would naturally need relevant data accessibility. Accessibility to private patient information which corporations are not willing to give due to privacy concerns. Especially in preparation for cases such as a data breach, due to hackers potentially targeting patient health records. This can cause tremendous security concerns for both the company and, the patient, as it is shown by studies that even a slight leak of information can lead to the patient’s privacy being compromised.\n",
      "27\n",
      "Using AI in healthcare also raises concerns about clinical implementation. Humans, as displayed in films and sci-fi stories, fear that AI and robots may eliminate some of their jobs.\n",
      "28\n",
      "This has occurred in the past during the Industrial Revolution, and may well occur in the future. This may get rid of human office jobs in terms of efficiency, but AI and computers will always be one step above due to their processing speed. Additionally, there will be fewer errors made as there is no room for human error.\n",
      "29\n",
      "It can be argued that this may not necessarily be true due to unrealistic expectations, but it is still a stigma that can cause uproar in the workplace.\n",
      "There has been evidence suggesting that there are human and social biases at scale. Although, it was found that it was not the algorithm that was responsible, but rather the underlying data that contained social inequities.\n",
      "30\n",
      "This can lead to one race or type of individual being chosen over another, just based on the tone of their skin or place of origin. Since AI will be learning from older systems and data, it is not an impossibility that such discrimination may occur. Way to Make Artificial Intelligence a Pillar of Healthcare\n",
      "Multiple issues have arisen in AI making it difficult to form as a fundamental pillar in the healthcare environment. Difficulties such as relevant data accessibility, concern for clinical implementation, and ethical dilemmas will have to be faced in the future.\n",
      "31\n",
      "A proposed recommendation for resolving data accessibility for AI is to implement it only for participants willing to share their health information with ML systems which may maintain data privacies.\n",
      "32\n",
      "In addition, more stringent data security regulations are needed to maintain privacy through improving client-side data encryption and engaging federated learning to train models without data sharing. 31 , 33 , 34 This will mitigate the raising concern regarding the ethics of using AI in the healthcare industry, and will also give AI experience in processing healthcare data. Additionally, there are several more ethical concerns for AI. It will be difficult to hold any person accountable when a poor decision is made. Keeping accountability of AI systems in practice through enforcing strict regulations, performing regular auditing, and validation are suggested to ensure better human-centered AI systems. 35 , 36 It is imperative that patients are fully aware when AI is processing their information, and that they fully consent to the use of their information for ML. Slowly, as AI improves information processing in healthcare, there could potentially be fewer mistakes than with actual humans. There is also the threat of personal bias toward AI systems, in which people will begin to completely depend on machine work and not make any personal decisions.\n",
      "37\n",
      "It will be very difficult to ensure that workers will not do this, and this can only be mitigated by proper training for health experts, medical, and other associated staff in handling AI equipment properly to ensure maximum accuracy in disease screening and treatment.\n",
      "38\n",
      "AI education should be developed in a way that can be easy for healthcare workers to understand, and leave room for personal decisions at the discretion of health experts.\n",
      "39\n",
      ",\n",
      "40\n",
      "AI can potentially increase workforce efficiency by conducting information processing, leaving healthcare professionals to focus on the vital parts of work.\n",
      "41\n",
      ",\n",
      "42\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "According to the present observation and available evidence, AI has some impact on healthcare settings. Assisting physicians in accurate, quick diagnosis and developing effective treatment plans, expediting patient waiting time, reducing redundant paperwork for nurses, and ensuring the regulatory requirements can be examples of the use of AI in healthcare. Besides the benefits of AI in the medical sector, the negative consequences need to be judged well for use in the workforce. Resolving data accessibility, maintaining data privacy, ensuring the authenticity of ChatGPT, maintaining accountability, and proper training of the health associates are the parameters to overcome the negative aspects of AI.

      "The influence of artificial intelligence (AI) has drastically risen in recent years, especially in the field of medicine. Its influence has spread so greatly that it is determined to become a pillar in the future medical world. A comprehensive literature search related to AI in healthcare was performed in the PubMed database and retrieved the relevant information from suitable ones. AI excels in aspects such as rapid adaptation, high diagnostic accuracy, and data management that can help improve workforce productivity. With this potential in sight, the FDA has continuously approved more machine learning (ML) software to be used by medical workers and scientists. However, there are few controversies such as increased chances of data breaches, concern for clinical implementation, and potential healthcare dilemmas. In this article, the positive and negative aspects of AI implementation in healthcare are discussed, as well as recommended some potential solutions to the potential issues at hand.\n",
      "Keywords: Artificial intelligence, machine learning, healthcare, health services, drug design, public health Background\n",
      "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the programing of computer systems to analyze, problem-solve, and make decisions just as a human would.\n",
      "1\n",
      "AI was first introduced in the 1950s with many limitations which made it difficult to be introduced into healthcare but has since developed into what we use today in modern medicine.\n",
      "2\n",
      "AI began as a simple system series that analyzed “if this, then this. . . rules” used broadly to advancement into algorithms personalized individually.\n",
      "2\n",
      "Early AI in medicine from the 1950s to 1970s has not received much attention and has a lack of acceptance by the scientific communities.\n",
      "2\n",
      "This period was more focused on the ability to digitize all data into electronic medical record systems and clinical informatics databases. As well as aid in the development of today’s search engines, such as PubMed.\n",
      "3\n",
      "The mid-1970s began the flourishment of biomedical search engines, expanding into universities such as Rutgers and Stanford.\n",
      "2\n",
      "This created an enhanced networking system for collaboration between several universities for research, later resulting in the first National Institutes of Health (NIH) workshop-the start of collaboration events of the future.\n",
      "2\n",
      "The first of many prototypes of how AI in medicine could positively impact the future started in the late 70s with the introduction of the consultation program Causal-Associational Network (CASNET).\n",
      "2\n",
      "The program could use disease data, apply it to an individual, and give advice to the physician on how to help the patient manage the disease.\n",
      "2\n",
      "Later, a bacterial pathogen and antibiotic treatment diagnostic AI developed from MYCIN to EMYCIN to INTERNIST-1 in just a few years.\n",
      "2\n",
      "The evolution of this system elaborated on the already extensive AI medical knowledge to help assist primary care physicians (PCPs).\n",
      "2\n",
      "The AI program that prompted the most influence of AI in medicine was introduced in 1986-DXplain.\n",
      "2\n",
      "PCPs were able to input their patient’s symptoms, and the program responded with a diagnosis, along with a description of the disease and additional references for the physicians.\n",
      "2\n",
      "The program started with 500 diseases and has now expanded to over 2400.\n",
      "2\n",
      "The early 2000s introduced Watson, an open-domain question-answering system.\n",
      "2\n",
      "This system used the electronic medical record with other electronic resources to provide physicians with evidence-based solutions to their patients’ questions.\n",
      "2\n",
      "Watson was later expanded upon for the exploration of medical research into new areas. Thus, beginning the expansion of AI into other areas such as pharmacy and patient intake at primary care practices.\n",
      "2\n",
      "Advancements in AI programs have been happening since it was first introduced in the 1950s.\n",
      "2\n",
      "The use of them has had a positive impact on the quality of medicine improving accuracy, consistency, and efficiency in all aspects. AI in medicine has evolved over the last 5 decades into personalized diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventative care. In this article, it is discussed how artificial intelligence can positively impact the future of medicine, along with its downsides. Methodology\n",
      "A comprehensive literature (Scopus indexed and Web of Science) search related to AI in healthcare, like AI background, and its positive and negative impacts on health settings, drug design, and development, disease screening, and treatment was performed in the PubMed database and extracted the relevant information from appropriate ones. Literature written only in English was selected for this review. The literature discussed the impacts of AI in other industries like automotive, robots, business, banking, etc. was excluded from our considerations. Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare Services\n",
      "AI is used daily in many areas of modern healthcare, from the online scheduling service for appointments to drug interaction warnings when physicians prescribe multiple medications to research development.\n",
      "4\n",
      "The most widely known and accepted evidence-based medicine used today are flowcharts and database research. A physician will take the patient’s history, current symptoms, and lab results to determine the proper diagnosis and give the appropriate treatment plan. An AI system will do this same process, in a fraction amount of time and have greater accuracy because it can tap into multiple databases at once.\n",
      "4\n",
      "This is only a small area in which AI has tapped into modern medicine.\n",
      "Other areas of medicine that have embraced AI include medical imaging, gastroenterology, surgery, and online consultations and therapy. Radiology has taken the largest leap into AI technology with its first use in image acquisition and storage, to now the use of computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD).\n",
      "3\n",

      "13\n",
      "From these results, it is shown that AI models could be what physicians need to confidently advance with a treatment plan. Likewise, AI models would greatly improve the volume of patient’s physicians can move through. This added speed would decrease the time patients wait for a diagnosis, as well as expediting the diagnosis to the treatment period. Let alone work for physicians, AI can also provide tremendous care in regulatory requirements and redundant paperwork for nurses.\n",
      "14\n",
      "These redundant but necessary parts of a nurse’s job require about 25% of their time on shift, which can be used more efficiently by being alongside a patient.\n",
      "13\n",
      "Another advantage of AI in the healthcare world is rapid adaptation. The timeline for reporting a new foodborne illness in foodborne outbreaks is about 3 to 4 weeks according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n",
      "15\n",
      "An AI system could identify an uncommon set of symptoms or bacterial strains much faster than a physician or laboratory. Which, for new diseases or outbreaks, could be the difference between a containable epidemic, or an uncontrolled pandemic. Evidence of such potential is shown in a study by the University of Oxford, in which AI identified viruses by analyzing their fluorescent labels. As a result, strains of respiratory viruses such as the flu and Covid-19 were identified with >97% accuracy within 5 minutes.\n",
      "16\n",
      "Regarding the diagnosis of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), a team of researchers developed an AI system that accurately diagnosed NCP with 92.49% accuracy, 94.93% sensitivity, and 91.13% specificity.\n",
      "17\n",
      "This point is apparent in the light of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Perhaps, with the availability and assistance of this technology, the impact of the Covid-19 crisis could have been mitigated. Negative Impacts of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare\n",
      "The debate about incorporating AI into healthcare has raised controversy in the workforce. With the intent to make AI a fundamental pillar in healthcare, several drawbacks and difficulties have been put into consideration. Difficulties such as relevant data accessibility, concern for clinical implementation, and ethical dilemmas between AI and patients.\n",
      "In an analysis of current AI capabilities, it can be argued that the negatives outweigh the positives. The most popular AI platform ChatGPT, has been proven a lack of authenticity regarding references used in medical articles.\n",
      "18\n",
      "The ChatGPT generated 30 short medical papers, each with at least 3 references, and a worse outcome has been found. Overall, 115 references in those medical articles, 47% were fabricated, 46% were authentic but inaccurate, and only 7% of them were authentic and accurately analyzed the information.\n",
      "18\n",
      "In response to this, it is very difficult to justify using AI in the medical world provided its current accuracy.\n",
      "The major ethical concern with AI in health services stems from the common use of electronic health records and their preferential targeting in data breaches. 19 , 20 These electronic health records, if filled out by a comprehensive AI, could contain more sensitive information about a patient than if it was filled by a healthcare professional. This comprehensive AI could be taking quantitative data, and extrapolating it into a probability of health risks and concerns, which would give greater detail into a patient’s medical history to bad actors wanting to sell this information and raise serious privacy concerns.\n",
      "21\n",
      "Beyond privacy, the accountability for the misdiagnosis of an AI is also of issue. AIs are touted as more accurate than physicians in their diagnosis, one study found that AI involved in the diagnosis of arrhythmias had an average F1 score of 0.84 compared to the average cardiologist score, of 0.78.\n",
      "22\n",
      "In the instance of a cardiologist defaulting to this AI in their diagnosis when they are uncertain, they would be making the best choice they could make in that instant, but if the AI misdiagnoses this patient, and creates a worse situation, it is hard to pin the blame on the cardiologist.\n",
      "22\n",
      "In addition, legal action regarding the error will be very difficult to execute because artificial intelligence cannot be held accountable as a real person would. These issues need to be cleared before AI can be implemented in any impactful way in the diagnosis of serious health conditions. To overcome these obstacles, several approaches like developing ethical governance, model explainability, model interpretability, and ethical auditing possible solutions have been recommended to maximize fairness, accountability, and transparency.\n",
      "23\n",
      "AI needs a larger quantity of data and relevant data accessibility to operate its functions. 24 , 25 For ML, a process that allows AI to learn without direct instruction to work efficiently, it would need a large quantity of data sets. 25 , 26 As such, if healthcare providers wanted AI to learn relevant patient data and learn how to manage healthcare databases, the AI would naturally need relevant data accessibility. Accessibility to private patient information which corporations are not willing to give due to privacy concerns. Especially in preparation for cases such as a data breach, due to hackers potentially targeting patient health records. This can cause tremendous security concerns for both the company and, the patient, as it is shown by studies that even a slight leak of information can lead to the patient’s privacy being compromised.\n",
      "27\n",
      "Using AI in healthcare also raises concerns about clinical implementation. Humans, as displayed in films and sci-fi stories, fear that AI and robots may eliminate some of their jobs.\n",
      "28\n",
      "This has occurred in the past during the Industrial Revolution, and may well occur in the future. This may get rid of human office jobs in terms of efficiency, but AI and computers will always be one step above due to their processing speed. Additionally, there will be fewer errors made as there is no room for human error.\n",
      "29\n",
      "It can be argued that this may not necessarily be true due to unrealistic expectations, but it is still a stigma that can cause uproar in the workplace.\n",
      "There has been evidence suggesting that there are human and social biases at scale. Although, it was found that it was not the algorithm that was responsible, but rather the underlying data that contained social inequities.\n",
      "30\n",
      "This can lead to one race or type of individual being chosen over another, just based on the tone of their skin or place of origin. Since AI will be learning from older systems and data, it is not an impossibility that such discrimination may occur. Way to Make Artificial Intelligence a Pillar of Healthcare\n",
      "Multiple issues have arisen in AI making it difficult to form as a fundamental pillar in the healthcare environment. Difficulties such as relevant data accessibility, concern for clinical implementation, and ethical dilemmas will have to be faced in the future.\n",
      "31\n",
      "A proposed recommendation for resolving data accessibility for AI is to implement it only for participants willing to share their health information with ML systems which may maintain data privacies.\n",
      "32\n",
      "In addition, more stringent data security regulations are needed to maintain privacy through improving client-side data encryption and engaging federated learning to train models without data sharing. 31 , 33 , 34 This will mitigate the raising concern regarding the ethics of using AI in the healthcare industry, and will also give AI experience in processing healthcare data. Additionally, there are several more ethical concerns for AI. It will be difficult to hold any person accountable when a poor decision is made. Keeping accountability of AI systems in practice through enforcing strict regulations, performing regular auditing, and validation are suggested to ensure better human-centered AI systems. 35 , 36 It is imperative that patients are fully aware when AI is processing their information, and that they fully consent to the use of their information for ML. Slowly, as AI improves information processing in healthcare, there could potentially be fewer mistakes than with actual humans. There is also the threat of personal bias toward AI systems, in which people will begin to completely depend on machine work and not make any personal decisions.\n",
      "37\n",
      "It will be very difficult to ensure that workers will not do this, and this can only be mitigated by proper training for health experts, medical, and other associated staff in handling AI equipment properly to ensure maximum accuracy in disease screening and treatment.\n",
      "38\n",
      "AI education should be developed in a way that can be easy for healthcare workers to understand, and leave room for personal decisions at the discretion of health experts.\n",
      "39\n",
      ",\n",
      "40\n",
      "AI can potentially increase workforce efficiency by conducting information processing, leaving healthcare professionals to focus on the vital parts of work.\n",
      "41\n",
      ",\n",
      "42\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "According to the present observation and available evidence, AI has some impact on healthcare settings. Assisting physicians in accurate, quick diagnosis and developing effective treatment plans, expediting patient waiting time, reducing redundant paperwork for nurses, and ensuring the regulatory requirements can be examples of the use of AI in healthcare. Besides the benefits of AI in the medical sector, the negative consequences need to be judged well for use in the workforce. Resolving data accessibility, maintaining data privacy, ensuring the authenticity of ChatGPT, maintaining accountability, and proper training of the health associates are the parameters to overcome the negative aspects of AI.

      "The influence of artificial intelligence (AI) has drastically risen in recent years, especially in the field of medicine. Its influence has spread so greatly that it is determined to become a pillar in the future medical world. A comprehensive literature search related to AI in healthcare was performed in the PubMed database and retrieved the relevant information from suitable ones. AI excels in aspects such as rapid adaptation, high diagnostic accuracy, and data management that can help improve workforce productivity. With this potential in sight, the FDA has continuously approved more machine learning (ML) software to be used by medical workers and scientists. However, there are few controversies such as increased chances of data breaches, concern for clinical implementation, and potential healthcare dilemmas. In this article, the positive and negative aspects of AI implementation in healthcare are discussed, as well as recommended some potential solutions to the potential issues at hand.\n",
      "Keywords: Artificial intelligence, machine learning, healthcare, health services, drug design, public health Background\n",
      "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the programing of computer systems to analyze, problem-solve, and make decisions just as a human would.\n",
      "1\n",
      "AI was first introduced in the 1950s with many limitations which made it difficult to be introduced into healthcare but has since developed into what we use today in modern medicine.\n",
      "2\n",
      "AI began as a simple system series that analyzed “if this, then this. . . rules” used broadly to advancement into algorithms personalized individually.\n",
      "2\n",
      "Early AI in medicine from the 1950s to 1970s has not received much attention and has a lack of acceptance by the scientific communities.\n",
      "2\n",
      "This period was more focused on the ability to digitize all data into electronic medical record systems and clinical informatics databases. As well as aid in the development of today’s search engines, such as PubMed.\n",
      "3\n",
      "The mid-1970s began the flourishment of biomedical search engines, expanding into universities such as Rutgers and Stanford.\n",
      "2\n",
      "This created an enhanced networking system for collaboration between several universities for research, later resulting in the first National Institutes of Health (NIH) workshop-the start of collaboration events of the future.\n",
      "2\n",
      "The first of many prototypes of how AI in medicine could positively impact the future started in the late 70s with the introduction of the consultation program Causal-Associational Network (CASNET).\n",
      "2\n",
      "The program could use disease data, apply it to an individual, and give advice to the physician on how to help the patient manage the disease.\n",
      "2\n",
      "Later, a bacterial pathogen and antibiotic treatment diagnostic AI developed from MYCIN to EMYCIN to INTERNIST-1 in just a few years.\n",
      "2\n",
      "The evolution of this system elaborated on the already extensive AI medical knowledge to help assist primary care physicians (PCPs).\n",
      "2\n",
      "The AI program that prompted the most influence of AI in medicine was introduced in 1986-DXplain.\n",
      "2\n",
      "PCPs were able to input their patient’s symptoms, and the program responded with a diagnosis, along with a description of the disease and additional references for the physicians.\n",
      "2\n",
      "The program started with 500 diseases and has now expanded to over 2400.\n",
      "2\n",
      "The early 2000s introduced Watson, an open-domain question-answering system.\n",
      "2\n",
      "This system used the electronic medical record with other electronic resources to provide physicians with evidence-based solutions to their patients’ questions.\n",
      "2\n",
      "Watson was later expanded upon for the exploration of medical research into new areas. Thus, beginning the expansion of AI into other areas such as pharmacy and patient intake at primary care practices.\n",
      "2\n",
      "Advancements in AI programs have been happening since it was first introduced in the 1950s.\n",
      "2\n",
      "The use of them has had a positive impact on the quality of medicine improving accuracy, consistency, and efficiency in all aspects. AI in medicine has evolved over the last 5 decades into personalized diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventative care. In this article, it is discussed how artificial intelligence can positively impact the future of medicine, along with its downsides. Methodology\n",
      "A comprehensive literature (Scopus indexed and Web of Science) search related to AI in healthcare, like AI background, and its positive and negative impacts on health settings, drug design, and development, disease screening, and treatment was performed in the PubMed database and extracted the relevant information from appropriate ones. Literature written only in English was selected for this review. The literature discussed the impacts of AI in other industries like automotive, robots, business, banking, etc. was excluded from our considerations. Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare Services\n",
      "AI is used daily in many areas of modern healthcare, from the online scheduling service for appointments to drug interaction warnings when physicians prescribe multiple medications to research development.\n",
      "4\n",
      "The most widely known and accepted evidence-based medicine used today are flowcharts and database research. A physician will take the patient’s history, current symptoms, and lab results to determine the proper diagnosis and give the appropriate treatment plan. An AI system will do this same process, in a fraction amount of time and have greater accuracy because it can tap into multiple databases at once.\n",
      "4\n",
      "This is only a small area in which AI has tapped into modern medicine.\n",
      "Other areas of medicine that have embraced AI include medical imaging, gastroenterology, surgery, and online consultations and therapy. Radiology has taken the largest leap into AI technology with its first use in image acquisition and storage, to now the use of computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD).\n",
      "3\n",
      "AI is on its way to helping to decrease the workload on radiologists with quick identification of negative exams and heightened turn-around time for abnormal ones.\n",
      "5\n",
      "In 2017, Arterys was the first FDA-approved deep learning application of AI in healthcare.\n",
      "2\n",
      "Deep learning (DL) can be used to detect lesions, compose reports, and create differential diagnoses.\n",
      "3\n",
      "The first product could analyze cardiac magnetic resonance images in seconds to measure ejection fraction, and since has evolved to liver, lung, chest, and musculoskeletal imaging, and non-contrast CAT scans.\n",
      "2\n",
      "DL has since expanded more, with the ability to screen diabetic retinopathy, identification of melanoma and nonmelanoma, prevention of cardiovascular risk, and prediction of Alzheimer’s disease progression by analysis of amyloid data.\n",
      "2\n",
      "The development of AI has helped in CAD in gastroenterology also. AI can be applied to colonoscopies to help in the identification and verification of benign versus malignant colon polyps.\n",
      "2\n",
      "With the use of the same AI technology, it has been used to differentiate between pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer – something once considered a challenge to determine.\n",
      "2\n",
      "On the other side, AI assistance has also been crucial for endoscopies. The AI CAD system has been deemed beneficial for the differentiation between adenomas and polyps, the improvement of imaging, and the development of prediction models for patient prognoses and treatment.\n",
      "2\n",
      "The use of AI for diagnostic procedures has since developed into aiding in surgical ones. Robotic arms are the way of the future for surgeries, starting in the fields of urology and gynecology. The robotic arms are set to mimic the surgeon’s hands but with more precise movements and better magnification.\n",
      "3\n",
      "The practice of AI within the PCP office to care for patients is rapidly turning into online consultations, advice visits, medication refills, orders of test kits, and much more. A patient can request a consultation with a specific physician based on how they fill out their questionnaire before the visit.\n",
      "3\n",
      "This questionnaire will answer the basic questions of past medical history and current symptoms, from that the AI will generate what the physician should order and treatment options.\n",
      "3\n",
      "The AI technology for PCP visits is slowly expanding into therapy facilities as well. AI therapy offers an online course for patients to use to help in the treatment of their diagnosis.\n",
      "3\n",
      "All the advancements of AI in medicine have come a long way, but there is always room for improvement and expansion. Artificial Intelligence in Drug Design and Development\n",
      "Recent studies have also found AI to be useful in reducing time and costs in pharmaceutical technology and drug delivery design.\n",
      "6\n",
      "More specifically, machine learning (ML: for forecasting drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) and deep learning (DL: for predicting various pharmacokinetic parameters, such as drug absorption, bioavailability, clearance, volume of distribution, and half-life) algorithms can predict the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of potential drug candidates. 6 , 7 This can drastically reduce the need and purchase of animals for testing and similarly save time. Large companies such as Pfizer, Bayer, and Roche have announced that AI can help use data to make faster decisions and allow them to develop therapies in immune-oncology and cardiovascular diseases. 8 , 9 More specifically, AI may help in choosing which medications not to pursue, potentially mitigating the chances of a poor decision, and reducing the R&D cost.\n",
      "8\n",
      "In related cases, AI is being adopted in pharmacometrics to aid in describing non-linear relationships using ML-based techniques.\n",
      "10\n",
      "Although it is currently only in the simulation phase, the experimental results demonstrated that the trained network “was able to correctly predict the treatment effects across a certain range of dose levels.”\n",
      "10\n",
      "In other words, the ML system was able to prescribe correct treatments up to a certain dosage. This shows the potential of AI in not only clinical cases but also in other fields of medicine. Positive Aspects of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare\n",
      "AI has a variety of positive aspects related to its application in healthcare. Currently, it is primarily used in the diagnosis of cancer, neurological diseases, and cardiovascular diseases.\n",
      "11\n",
      "Early detection of NCP plays an important role in transmission prevention and positive outcomes in treatment.\n",
      "12\n",
      "Additionally, in the diagnosis of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) V600E mutation in colorectal carcinomas, the AI model used presented a 93.8% diagnostic accuracy.\n",
      "13\n",
      "From these results, it is shown that AI models could be what physicians need to confidently advance with a treatment plan. Likewise, AI models would greatly improve the volume of patient’s physicians can move through. This added speed would decrease the time patients wait for a diagnosis, as well as expediting the diagnosis to the treatment period. Let alone work for physicians, AI can also provide tremendous care in regulatory requirements and redundant paperwork for nurses.\n",
      "14\n",
      "These redundant but necessary parts of a nurse’s job require about 25% of their time on shift, which can be used more efficiently by being alongside a patient.\n",
      "13\n",
      "Another advantage of AI in the healthcare world is rapid adaptation. The timeline for reporting a new foodborne illness in foodborne outbreaks is about 3 to 4 weeks according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n",
      "15\n",
      "An AI system could identify an uncommon set of symptoms or bacterial strains much faster than a physician or laboratory. Which, for new diseases or outbreaks, could be the difference between a containable epidemic, or an uncontrolled pandemic. Evidence of such potential is shown in a study by the University of Oxford, in which AI identified viruses by analyzing their fluorescent labels. As a result, strains of respiratory viruses such as the flu and Covid-19 were identified with >97% accuracy within 5 minutes.\n",
      "16\n",
      "Regarding the diagnosis of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), a team of researchers developed an AI system that accurately diagnosed NCP with 92.49% accuracy, 94.93% sensitivity, and 91.13% specificity.\n",
      "17\n",
      "This point is apparent in the light of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Perhaps, with the availability and assistance of this technology, the impact of the Covid-19 crisis could have been mitigated. Negative Impacts of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare\n",
      "The debate about incorporating AI into healthcare has raised controversy in the workforce. With the intent to make AI a fundamental pillar in healthcare, several drawbacks and difficulties have been put into consideration. Difficulties such as relevant data accessibility, concern for clinical implementation, and ethical dilemmas between AI and patients.\n",
      "In an analysis of current AI capabilities, it can be argued that the negatives outweigh the positives. The most popular AI platform ChatGPT, has been proven a lack of authenticity regarding references used in medical articles.\n",
      "18\n",
      "The ChatGPT generated 30 short medical papers, each with at least 3 references, and a worse outcome has been found. Overall, 115 references in those medical articles, 47% were fabricated, 46% were authentic but inaccurate, and only 7% of them were authentic and accurately analyzed the information.\n",

      "In response to this, it is very difficult to justify using AI in the medical world provided its current accuracy.\n",
      "The major ethical concern with AI in health services stems from the common use of electronic health records and their preferential targeting in data breaches. 19 , 20 These electronic health records, if filled out by a comprehensive AI, could contain more sensitive information about a patient than if it was filled by a healthcare professional. This comprehensive AI could be taking quantitative data, and extrapolating it into a probability of health risks and concerns, which would give greater detail into a patient’s medical history to bad actors wanting to sell this information and raise serious privacy concerns.\n",
      "21\n",
      "Beyond privacy, the accountability for the misdiagnosis of an AI is also of issue. AIs are touted as more accurate than physicians in their diagnosis, one study found that AI involved in the diagnosis of arrhythmias had an average F1 score of 0.84 compared to the average cardiologist score, of 0.78.\n",
      "22\n",
      "In the instance of a cardiologist defaulting to this AI in their diagnosis when they are uncertain, they would be making the best choice they could make in that instant, but if the AI misdiagnoses this patient, and creates a worse situation, it is hard to pin the blame on the cardiologist.\n",
      "22\n",
      "In addition, legal action regarding the error will be very difficult to execute because artificial intelligence cannot be held accountable as a real person would. These issues need to be cleared before AI can be implemented in any impactful way in the diagnosis of serious health conditions. To overcome these obstacles, several approaches like developing ethical governance, model explainability, model interpretability, and ethical auditing possible solutions have been recommended to maximize fairness, accountability, and transparency.\n",
      "23\n",
      "AI needs a larger quantity of data and relevant data accessibility to operate its functions. 24 , 25 For ML, a process that allows AI to learn without direct instruction to work efficiently, it would need a large quantity of data sets. 25 , 26 As such, if healthcare providers wanted AI to learn relevant patient data and learn how to manage healthcare databases, the AI would naturally need relevant data accessibility. Accessibility to private patient information which corporations are not willing to give due to privacy concerns. Especially in preparation for cases such as a data breach, due to hackers potentially targeting patient health records. This can cause tremendous security concerns for both the company and, the patient, as it is shown by studies that even a slight leak of information can lead to the patient’s privacy being compromised.\n",
      "27\n",
      "Using AI in healthcare also raises concerns about clinical implementation. Humans, as displayed in films and sci-fi stories, fear that AI and robots may eliminate some of their jobs.\n",
      "28\n",
      "This has occurred in the past during the Industrial Revolution, and may well occur in the future. This may get rid of human office jobs in terms of efficiency, but AI and computers will always be one step above due to their processing speed. Additionally, there will be fewer errors made as there is no room for human error.\n",
      "29\n",
      "It can be argued that this may not necessarily be true due to unrealistic expectations, but it is still a stigma that can cause uproar in the workplace.\n",
      "There has been evidence suggesting that there are human and social biases at scale. Although, it was found that it was not the algorithm that was responsible, but rather the underlying data that contained social inequities.\n",
      "30\n",
      "This can lead to one race or type of individual being chosen over another, just based on the tone of their skin or place of origin. Since AI will be learning from older systems and data, it is not an impossibility that such discrimination may occur. Way to Make Artificial Intelligence a Pillar of Healthcare\n",
      "Multiple issues have arisen in AI making it difficult to form as a fundamental pillar in the healthcare environment. Difficulties such as relevant data accessibility, concern for clinical implementation, and ethical dilemmas will have to be faced in the future.\n",
      "31\n",
      "A proposed recommendation for resolving data accessibility for AI is to implement it only for participants willing to share their health information with ML systems which may maintain data privacies.\n",
      "32\n",
      "In addition, more stringent data security regulations are needed to maintain privacy through improving client-side data encryption and engaging federated learning to train models without data sharing. 31 , 33 , 34 This will mitigate the raising concern regarding the ethics of using AI in the healthcare industry, and will also give AI experience in processing healthcare data. Additionally, there are several more ethical concerns for AI. It will be difficult to hold any person accountable when a poor decision is made. Keeping accountability of AI systems in practice through enforcing strict regulations, performing regular auditing, and validation are suggested to ensure better human-centered AI systems. 35 , 36 It is imperative that patients are fully aware when AI is processing their information, and that they fully consent to the use of their information for ML. Slowly, as AI improves information processing in healthcare, there could potentially be fewer mistakes than with actual humans. There is also the threat of personal bias toward AI systems, in which people will begin to completely depend on machine work and not make any personal decisions.\n",
      "37\n",
      "It will be very difficult to ensure that workers will not do this, and this can only be mitigated by proper training for health experts, medical, and other associated staff in handling AI equipment properly to ensure maximum accuracy in disease screening and treatment.\n",
      "38\n",
      "AI education should be developed in a way that can be easy for healthcare workers to understand, and leave room for personal decisions at the discretion of health experts.\n",
      "39\n",
      ",\n",
      "40\n",
      "AI can potentially increase workforce efficiency by conducting information processing, leaving healthcare professionals to focus on the vital parts of work.\n",
      "41\n",
      ",\n",
      "42\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "According to the present observation and available evidence, AI has some impact on healthcare settings. Assisting physicians in accurate, quick diagnosis and developing effective treatment plans, expediting patient waiting time, reducing redundant paperwork for nurses, and ensuring the regulatory requirements can be examples of the use of AI in healthcare. Besides the benefits of AI in the medical sector, the negative consequences need to be judged well for use in the workforce. Resolving data accessibility, maintaining data privacy, ensuring the authenticity of ChatGPT, maintaining accountability, and proper training of the health associates are the parameters to overcome the negative aspects of AI.

      "A study published in 2024 revealed that artificial intelligence (AI) tools can analyze data from individual cells within tumors to forecast whether a patient’s cancer will react to a particular drug. Another study by Google Health showed that their AI model could detect breast cancer from mammogram images with the accuracy of a trained radiologist. Their AI model reduced false positive and false negative rates and outperformed six expert radiologists . However, the researchers noted challenges in the clinical deployment of AI tools, citing issues like integrating it into existing radiology workflows and establishing regulatory approval processes.\n",
      "AI In Healthcare: The Top Five Challenges\n",
      "The case of AI in mammography is an excellent example of how implementing AI in healthcare can improve and streamline patient care, diagnostic procedures and more. However, it also shows that the path to successful AI implementation in healthcare is paved with obstacles. Let’s explore the top five challenges hindering the widespread adoption of AI in the healthcare industry.\n",
      "1. Data Quality And Accessibility\n",
      "One of the biggest stumbling blocks to real-world AI implementation has been a deceptively simple challenge: access to high-quality data. Experts predict that the CAGR of healthcare data will reach 36% by 2025. This massive increase in healthcare data poses great opportunities. At the same time, it introduces significant challenges for health tech companies adopting AI technology.\n",
      "The volume of data doesn’t guarantee its quality and availability. Healthcare data is often fragmented across different systems, leading to inaccuracies and inconsistencies. These inaccuracies can adversely affect the performance and reliability of AI models, leading to flawed insights and recommendations. Addressing data quality and accessibility challenges lays the foundation for the transformative potential of AI in healthcare.\n",
      "2. Implementation Cost\n",
      "Cleveland Clinic has been at the forefront of implementing AI in healthcare and overcoming data quality issues. By successfully implementing AI solutions to analyze patient flow and optimize scheduling, they’ve reduced wait times by 10% .\n",
      "Yet, achieving this level of AI integration requires significant investment in technological infrastructure, regulatory compliance, staff training and more. Organizations can mitigate these financial barriers by using trusted, experienced resources that reduce the cost of implementation and avoid wasteful steps.\n",
      "For example, the appropriate use of RAG architecture can significantly reduce runtime expenses and increase the performance and quality of the output. Additionally, companies often don’t fully grasp the complexity of working with AI, seeing only the tip of the iceberg and missing the hidden costs. Significant additional investment is required to realize its potential.\n",
      "3. Acceptance Of AI In Healthcare\n",
      "Beyond the executive level, AI implementation in healthcare affects patients and healthcare professionals in terms of human acceptance and trust issues. A 2023 study found that clinical staff may struggle to accept AI due to the need to learn new skills and take on more complex tasks.\n",
      "Experts focus on educational efforts and clear communication to address AI adoption concerns. Introducing AI systems that closely match current human activities—like predictive analytics for patient monitoring and virtual assistants for scheduling—demonstrates AI’s reliability and direct benefits, which may enhance overall acceptance in healthcare.\n",
      "4. Lack Of Experience In Evaluating AI Performance\n",
      "Without assessing AI systems’ performance, successful implementation is unlikely. This involves examining their integration with existing processes and measuring their accuracy and reliability, user satisfaction and overall impact on business goals. As AI technologies become increasingly integrated into healthcare systems, executives and clinical leaders often lack frameworks for assessing AI’s effectiveness and safety.\n",
      "This gap in experience can lead to challenges in determining how well AI solutions meet clinical goals, integrate with existing health IT systems, impact patient outcomes and affect the company’s financial performance. This challenge underscores the need for comprehensive training programs, partnerships with AI experts and the development of standardized evaluation frameworks to build the necessary expertise in this rapidly evolving field.\n",
      "5. Technical Complexity And Skill Gaps\n",
      "Last but not least, developing and deploying AI solutions in healthcare requires specialized technical expertise in machine learning, data science and software engineering. However, there’s a shortage of skilled professionals with the necessary knowledge and experience to design, implement and maintain AI-driven systems in healthcare settings.\n",
      "More importantly, there’s a gap in the skills needed to develop strategies for implementing AI from a business value perspective. The role of the chief AI officer (CAIO) has recently been rising to fill these gaps. Regardless, there’s still a significant skills gap in the workforce regarding the understanding and management of AI technologies, according to a 2023 study by GlobalData .\n",
      "Before implementing AI, experts recommend building trust and confidence in AI across all healthcare workforce levels, including providers, IT staff, executives and administrators. Involving existing staff leverages their familiarity with operations, but incorporating external expertise—such as hiring a CAIO or consulting with outsourcing firms—can help navigate implementation challenges effectively.\n",
      "Takeaways\n",
      "The integration of AI into healthcare is met with excitement and caution. Innovative AI applications generate industrywide enthusiasm but encounter challenges like data quality, regulatory hurdles and workforce skepticism. These issues often temper initial optimism, highlighting the complex path to adoption.\n",
      "Despite challenges, the increasing adoption of AI in healthcare suggests a transformative future. With the market expected to reach $188 billion by 2030 , overcoming obstacles with innovation can significantly enhance healthcare quality, efficiency and accessibility, making AI a fundamental improvement rather than a fleeting trend.\n",

      "A study published in 2024 revealed that artificial intelligence (AI) tools can analyze data from individual cells within tumors to forecast whether a patient’s cancer will react to a particular drug. Another study by Google Health showed that their AI model could detect breast cancer from mammogram images with the accuracy of a trained radiologist. Their AI model reduced false positive and false negative rates and outperformed six expert radiologists . However, the researchers noted challenges in the clinical deployment of AI tools, citing issues like integrating it into existing radiology workflows and establishing regulatory approval processes.\n",

      "The case of AI in mammography is an excellent example of how implementing AI in healthcare can improve and streamline patient care, diagnostic procedures and more. However, it also shows that the path to successful AI implementation in healthcare is paved with obstacles. Let’s explore the top five challenges hindering the widespread adoption of AI in the healthcare industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Data Quality And Accessibility\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the biggest stumbling blocks to real-world AI implementation has been a deceptively simple challenge: access to high-quality data. Experts predict that the CAGR of healthcare data will reach 36% by 2025. This massive increase in healthcare data poses great opportunities. At the same time, it introduces significant challenges for health tech companies adopting AI technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The volume of data doesn’t guarantee its quality and availability. Healthcare data is often fragmented across different systems, leading to inaccuracies and inconsistencies. These inaccuracies can adversely affect the performance and reliability of AI models, leading to flawed insights and recommendations. Addressing data quality and accessibility challenges lays the foundation for the transformative potential of AI in healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Implementation Cost\n",
      "\n",
      "Cleveland Clinic has been at the forefront of implementing AI in healthcare and overcoming data quality issues. By successfully implementing AI solutions to analyze patient flow and optimize scheduling, they’ve reduced wait times by 10% .\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, achieving this level of AI integration requires significant investment in technological infrastructure, regulatory compliance, staff training and more. Organizations can mitigate these financial barriers by using trusted, experienced resources that reduce the cost of implementation and avoid wasteful steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the appropriate use of RAG architecture can significantly reduce runtime expenses and increase the performance and quality of the output. Additionally, companies often don’t fully grasp the complexity of working with AI, seeing only the tip of the iceberg and missing the hidden costs. Significant additional investment is required to realize its potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Acceptance Of AI In Healthcare\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the executive level, AI implementation in healthcare affects patients and healthcare professionals in terms of human acceptance and trust issues. A 2023 study found that clinical staff may struggle to accept AI due to the need to learn new skills and take on more complex tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts focus on educational efforts and clear communication to address AI adoption concerns. Introducing AI systems that closely match current human activities—like predictive analytics for patient monitoring and virtual assistants for scheduling—demonstrates AI’s reliability and direct benefits, which may enhance overall acceptance in healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Lack Of Experience In Evaluating AI Performance\n",
      "\n",
      "Without assessing AI systems’ performance, successful implementation is unlikely. This involves examining their integration with existing processes and measuring their accuracy and reliability, user satisfaction and overall impact on business goals. As AI technologies become increasingly integrated into healthcare systems, executives and clinical leaders often lack frameworks for assessing AI’s effectiveness and safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "This gap in experience can lead to challenges in determining how well AI solutions meet clinical goals, integrate with existing health IT systems, impact patient outcomes and affect the company’s financial performance. This challenge underscores the need for comprehensive training programs, partnerships with AI experts and the development of standardized evaluation frameworks to build the necessary expertise in this rapidly evolving field.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Technical Complexity And Skill Gaps\n",
      "\n",
      "Last but not least, developing and deploying AI solutions in healthcare requires specialized technical expertise in machine learning, data science and software engineering. However, there’s a shortage of skilled professionals with the necessary knowledge and experience to design, implement and maintain AI-driven systems in healthcare settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "More importantly, there’s a gap in the skills needed to develop strategies for implementing AI from a business value perspective. The role of the chief AI officer (CAIO) has recently been rising to fill these gaps. Regardless, there’s still a significant skills gap in the workforce regarding the understanding and management of AI technologies, according to a 2023 study by GlobalData .\n",
      "\n",
      "Before implementing AI, experts recommend building trust and confidence in AI across all healthcare workforce levels, including providers, IT staff, executives and administrators. Involving existing staff leverages their familiarity with operations, but incorporating external expertise—such as hiring a CAIO or consulting with outsourcing firms—can help navigate implementation challenges effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Takeaways\n",
      "\n",
      "The integration of AI into healthcare is met with excitement and caution. Innovative AI applications generate industrywide enthusiasm but encounter challenges like data quality, regulatory hurdles and workforce skepticism. These issues often temper initial optimism, highlighting the complex path to adoption.\n",

      "Despite challenges, the increasing adoption of AI in healthcare suggests a transformative future.

      "\n",
      "A study published in 2024 revealed that artificial intelligence (AI) tools can analyze data from individual cells within tumors to forecast whether a patient’s cancer will react to a particular drug. Another study by Google Health showed that their AI model could detect breast cancer from mammogram images with the accuracy of a trained radiologist. Their AI model reduced false positive and false negative rates and outperformed six expert radiologists . However, the researchers noted challenges in the clinical deployment of AI tools, citing issues like integrating it into existing radiology workflows and establishing regulatory approval processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "AI In Healthcare: The Top Five Challenges\n",
      "\n",
      "The case of AI in mammography is an excellent example of how implementing AI in healthcare can improve and streamline patient care, diagnostic procedures and more. However, it also shows that the path to successful AI implementation in healthcare is paved with obstacles. Let’s explore the top five challenges hindering the widespread adoption of AI in the healthcare industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Data Quality And Accessibility\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the biggest stumbling blocks to real-world AI implementation has been a deceptively simple challenge: access to high-quality data. Experts predict that the CAGR of healthcare data will reach 36% by 2025. This massive increase in healthcare data poses great opportunities. At the same time, it introduces significant challenges for health tech companies adopting AI technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The volume of data doesn’t guarantee its quality and availability. Healthcare data is often fragmented across different systems, leading to inaccuracies and inconsistencies. These inaccuracies can adversely affect the performance and reliability of AI models, leading to flawed insights and recommendations. Addressing data quality and accessibility challenges lays the foundation for the transformative potential of AI in healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Implementation Cost\n",
      "\n",
      "Cleveland Clinic has been at the forefront of implementing AI in healthcare and overcoming data quality issues. By successfully implementing AI solutions to analyze patient flow and optimize scheduling, they’ve reduced wait times by 10% .\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, achieving this level of AI integration requires significant investment in technological infrastructure, regulatory compliance, staff training and more. Organizations can mitigate these financial barriers by using trusted, experienced resources that reduce the cost of implementation and avoid wasteful steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the appropriate use of RAG architecture can significantly reduce runtime expenses and increase the performance and quality of the output. Additionally, companies often don’t fully grasp the complexity of working with AI, seeing only the tip of the iceberg and missing the hidden costs. Significant additional investment is required to realize its potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Acceptance Of AI In Healthcare\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the executive level, AI implementation in healthcare affects patients and healthcare professionals in terms of human acceptance and trust issues. A 2023 study found that clinical staff may struggle to accept AI due to the need to learn new skills and take on more complex tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts focus on educational efforts and clear communication to address AI adoption concerns. Introducing AI systems that closely match current human activities—like predictive analytics for patient monitoring and virtual assistants for scheduling—demonstrates AI’s reliability and direct benefits, which may enhance overall acceptance in healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Lack Of Experience In Evaluating AI Performance\n",
      "\n",
      "Without assessing AI systems’ performance, successful implementation is unlikely. This involves examining their integration with existing processes and measuring their accuracy and reliability, user satisfaction and overall impact on business goals. As AI technologies become increasingly integrated into healthcare systems, executives and clinical leaders often lack frameworks for assessing AI’s effectiveness and safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "This gap in experience can lead to challenges in determining how well AI solutions meet clinical goals, integrate with existing health IT systems, impact patient outcomes and affect the company’s financial performance. This challenge underscores the need for comprehensive training programs, partnerships with AI experts and the development of standardized evaluation frameworks to build the necessary expertise in this rapidly evolving field.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Technical Complexity And Skill Gaps\n",
      "\n",
      "Last but not least, developing and deploying AI solutions in healthcare requires specialized technical expertise in machine learning, data science and software engineering. However, there’s a shortage of skilled professionals with the necessary knowledge and experience to design, implement and maintain AI-driven systems in healthcare settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "More importantly, there’s a gap in the skills needed to develop strategies for implementing AI from a business value perspective. The role of the chief AI officer (CAIO) has recently been rising to fill these gaps. Regardless, there’s still a significant skills gap in the workforce regarding the understanding and management of AI technologies, according to a 2023 study by GlobalData .\n",
      "\n",
      "Before implementing AI, experts recommend building trust and confidence in AI across all healthcare workforce levels, including providers, IT staff, executives and administrators. Involving existing staff leverages their familiarity with operations, but incorporating external expertise—such as hiring a CAIO or consulting with outsourcing firms—can help navigate implementation challenges effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Takeaways\n",
      "\n",
      "The integration of AI into healthcare is met with excitement and caution. Innovative AI applications generate industrywide enthusiasm but encounter challenges like data quality, regulatory hurdles and workforce skepticism. These issues often temper initial optimism, highlighting the complex path to adoption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite challenges, the increasing adoption of AI in healthcare suggests a transformative future. With the market expected to reach $188 billion by 2030 , overcoming obstacles with innovation can significantly enhance healthcare quality, efficiency and accessibility, making AI a fundamental improvement rather than a fleeting trend.\n",

      "A study published in 2024 revealed that artificial intelligence (AI) tools can analyze data from individual cells within tumors to forecast whether a patient’s cancer will react to a particular drug. Another study by Google Health showed that their AI model could detect breast cancer from mammogram images with the accuracy of a trained radiologist. Their AI model reduced false positive and false negative rates and outperformed six expert radiologists .

      "The case of AI in mammography is an excellent example of how implementing AI in healthcare can improve and streamline patient care, diagnostic procedures and more. However, it also shows that the path to successful AI implementation in healthcare is paved with obstacles. Let’s explore the top five challenges hindering the widespread adoption of AI in the healthcare industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Data Quality And Accessibility\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the biggest stumbling blocks to real-world AI implementation has been a deceptively simple challenge: access to high-quality data. Experts predict that the CAGR of healthcare data will reach 36% by 2025. This massive increase in healthcare data poses great opportunities. At the same time, it introduces significant challenges for health tech companies adopting AI technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The volume of data doesn’t guarantee its quality and availability. Healthcare data is often fragmented across different systems, leading to inaccuracies and inconsistencies. These inaccuracies can adversely affect the performance and reliability of AI models, leading to flawed insights and recommendations. Addressing data quality and accessibility challenges lays the foundation for the transformative potential of AI in healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Implementation Cost\n",
      "\n",
      "Cleveland Clinic has been at the forefront of implementing AI in healthcare and overcoming data quality issues. By successfully implementing AI solutions to analyze patient flow and optimize scheduling, they’ve reduced wait times by 10% .\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, achieving this level of AI integration requires significant investment in technological infrastructure, regulatory compliance, staff training and more. Organizations can mitigate these financial barriers by using trusted, experienced resources that reduce the cost of implementation and avoid wasteful steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the appropriate use of RAG architecture can significantly reduce runtime expenses and increase the performance and quality of the output. Additionally, companies often don’t fully grasp the complexity of working with AI, seeing only the tip of the iceberg and missing the hidden costs. Significant additional investment is required to realize its potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Acceptance Of AI In Healthcare\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the executive level, AI implementation in healthcare affects patients and healthcare professionals in terms of human acceptance and trust issues. A 2023 study found that clinical staff may struggle to accept AI due to the need to learn new skills and take on more complex tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts focus on educational efforts and clear communication to address AI adoption concerns. Introducing AI systems that closely match current human activities—like predictive analytics for patient monitoring and virtual assistants for scheduling—demonstrates AI’s reliability and direct benefits, which may enhance overall acceptance in healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Lack Of Experience In Evaluating AI Performance\n",
      "\n",
      "Without assessing AI systems’ performance, successful implementation is unlikely. This involves examining their integration with existing processes and measuring their accuracy and reliability, user satisfaction and overall impact on business goals. As AI technologies become increasingly integrated into healthcare systems, executives and clinical leaders often lack frameworks for assessing AI’s effectiveness and safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "This gap in experience can lead to challenges in determining how well AI solutions meet clinical goals, integrate with existing health IT systems, impact patient outcomes and affect the company’s financial performance. This challenge underscores the need for comprehensive training programs, partnerships with AI experts and the development of standardized evaluation frameworks to build the necessary expertise in this rapidly evolving field.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Technical Complexity And Skill Gaps\n",
      "\n",
      "Last but not least, developing and deploying AI solutions in healthcare requires specialized technical expertise in machine learning, data science and software engineering. However, there’s a shortage of skilled professionals with the necessary knowledge and experience to design, implement and maintain AI-driven systems in healthcare settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "More importantly, there’s a gap in the skills needed to develop strategies for implementing AI from a business value perspective. The role of the chief AI officer (CAIO) has recently been rising to fill these gaps. Regardless, there’s still a significant skills gap in the workforce regarding the understanding and management of AI technologies, according to a 2023 study by GlobalData .\n",
      "\n",
      "Before implementing AI, experts recommend building trust and confidence in AI across all healthcare workforce levels, including providers, IT staff, executives and administrators. Involving existing staff leverages their familiarity with operations, but incorporating external expertise—such as hiring a CAIO or consulting with outsourcing firms—can help navigate implementation challenges effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Takeaways\n",
      "\n",
      "The integration of AI into healthcare is met with excitement and caution. Innovative AI applications generate industrywide enthusiasm but encounter challenges like data quality, regulatory hurdles and workforce skepticism. These issues often temper initial optimism, highlighting the complex path to adoption.\n",

      "A study published in 2024 revealed that artificial intelligence (AI) tools can analyze data from individual cells within tumors to forecast whether a patient’s cancer will react to a particular drug. Another study by Google Health showed that their AI model could detect breast cancer from mammogram images with the accuracy of a trained radiologist. Their AI model reduced false positive and false negative rates and outperformed six expert radiologists . However, the researchers noted challenges in the clinical deployment of AI tools, citing issues like integrating it into existing radiology workflows and establishing regulatory approval processes.\n",

      "AI In Healthcare: The Top Five Challenges\n",
      "\n",
      "The case of AI in mammography is an excellent example of how implementing AI in healthcare can improve and streamline patient care, diagnostic procedures and more. However, it also shows that the path to successful AI implementation in healthcare is paved with obstacles. Let’s explore the top five challenges hindering the widespread adoption of AI in the healthcare industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Data Quality And Accessibility\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the biggest stumbling blocks to real-world AI implementation has been a deceptively simple challenge: access to high-quality data. Experts predict that the CAGR of healthcare data will reach 36% by 2025. This massive increase in healthcare data poses great opportunities. At the same time, it introduces significant challenges for health tech companies adopting AI technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The volume of data doesn’t guarantee its quality and availability. Healthcare data is often fragmented across different systems, leading to inaccuracies and inconsistencies. These inaccuracies can adversely affect the performance and reliability of AI models, leading to flawed insights and recommendations. Addressing data quality and accessibility challenges lays the foundation for the transformative potential of AI in healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Implementation Cost\n",
      "\n",
      "Cleveland Clinic has been at the forefront of implementing AI in healthcare and overcoming data quality issues. By successfully implementing AI solutions to analyze patient flow and optimize scheduling, they’ve reduced wait times by 10% .\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, achieving this level of AI integration requires significant investment in technological infrastructure, regulatory compliance, staff training and more. Organizations can mitigate these financial barriers by using trusted, experienced resources that reduce the cost of implementation and avoid wasteful steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the appropriate use of RAG architecture can significantly reduce runtime expenses and increase the performance and quality of the output. Additionally, companies often don’t fully grasp the complexity of working with AI, seeing only the tip of the iceberg and missing the hidden costs. Significant additional investment is required to realize its potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Acceptance Of AI In Healthcare\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the executive level, AI implementation in healthcare affects patients and healthcare professionals in terms of human acceptance and trust issues. A 2023 study found that clinical staff may struggle to accept AI due to the need to learn new skills and take on more complex tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts focus on educational efforts and clear communication to address AI adoption concerns. Introducing AI systems that closely match current human activities—like predictive analytics for patient monitoring and virtual assistants for scheduling—demonstrates AI’s reliability and direct benefits, which may enhance overall acceptance in healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Lack Of Experience In Evaluating AI Performance\n",
      "\n",
      "Without assessing AI systems’ performance, successful implementation is unlikely. This involves examining their integration with existing processes and measuring their accuracy and reliability, user satisfaction and overall impact on business goals. As AI technologies become increasingly integrated into healthcare systems, executives and clinical leaders often lack frameworks for assessing AI’s effectiveness and safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "This gap in experience can lead to challenges in determining how well AI solutions meet clinical goals, integrate with existing health IT systems, impact patient outcomes and affect the company’s financial performance. This challenge underscores the need for comprehensive training programs, partnerships with AI experts and the development of standardized evaluation frameworks to build the necessary expertise in this rapidly evolving field.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Technical Complexity And Skill Gaps\n",
      "\n",
      "Last but not least, developing and deploying AI solutions in healthcare requires specialized technical expertise in machine learning, data science and software engineering. However, there’s a shortage of skilled professionals with the necessary knowledge and experience to design, implement and maintain AI-driven systems in healthcare settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "More importantly, there’s a gap in the skills needed to develop strategies for implementing AI from a business value perspective. The role of the chief AI officer (CAIO) has recently been rising to fill these gaps. Regardless, there’s still a significant skills gap in the workforce regarding the understanding and management of AI technologies, according to a 2023 study by GlobalData .\n",
      "\n",
      "Before implementing AI, experts recommend building trust and confidence in AI across all healthcare workforce levels, including providers, IT staff, executives and administrators. Involving existing staff leverages their familiarity with operations, but incorporating external expertise—such as hiring a CAIO or consulting with outsourcing firms—can help navigate implementation challenges effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Takeaways\n",
      "\n",
      "The integration of AI into healthcare is met with excitement and caution. Innovative AI applications generate industrywide enthusiasm but encounter challenges like data quality, regulatory hurdles and workforce skepticism. These issues often temper initial optimism, highlighting the complex path to adoption.\n",

      "Beyond the executive level, AI implementation in healthcare affects patients and healthcare professionals in terms of human acceptance and trust issues. A 2023 study found that clinical staff may struggle to accept AI due to the need to learn new skills and take on more complex tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts focus on educational efforts and clear communication to address AI adoption concerns. Introducing AI systems that closely match current human activities—like predictive analytics for patient monitoring and virtual assistants for scheduling—demonstrates AI’s reliability and direct benefits, which may enhance overall acceptance in healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Lack Of Experience In Evaluating AI Performance\n",
      "\n",
      "Without assessing AI systems’ performance, successful implementation is unlikely. This involves examining their integration with existing processes and measuring their accuracy and reliability, user satisfaction and overall impact on business goals. As AI technologies become increasingly integrated into healthcare systems, executives and clinical leaders often lack frameworks for assessing AI’s effectiveness and safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "This gap in experience can lead to challenges in determining how well AI solutions meet clinical goals, integrate with existing health IT systems, impact patient outcomes and affect the company’s financial performance. This challenge underscores the need for comprehensive training programs, partnerships with AI experts and the development of standardized evaluation frameworks to build the necessary expertise in this rapidly evolving field.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Technical Complexity And Skill Gaps\n",
      "\n",
      "Last but not least, developing and deploying AI solutions in healthcare requires specialized technical expertise in machine learning, data science and software engineering. However, there’s a shortage of skilled professionals\u001b[00m\n"

      "Skip to main content Generative AI in healthcare: Current trends and future outlook March 26, 2025 | Article The healthcare sector has been integrating generative AI to enhance operations and engage stakeholders, with many advancing to full-scale implementation.\n",
      "(7 pages)\n",
      "Gen AI is rapidly transforming the healthcare industry. To understand the changing landscape, McKinsey has surveyed healthcare leaders since 2023 about their perspectives and approaches to gen AI (see sidebar, “Research methodology”).\n",
      "About the authors This article is a collaborative effort by Carlos Pardo Martin  and Jessica Lamb , with Amine Dahab, John Jones, and Shashank Bhasker, representing views from McKinsey’s Healthcare Practice.\n",
      "The latest survey, conducted in the fourth quarter of 2024, found that 85 percent of respondents—healthcare leaders from payers, health systems, and healthcare services and technology (HST) groups—were exploring or had already adopted gen AI capabilities.\n",
      "Research methodology To better understand how US healthcare leaders are thinking about gen AI use cases, McKinsey launched a research effort to gather insights from leaders in payer organizations, health systems, and healthcare services and technology (HST) groups. We surveyed stakeholders about their plans for generative AI solutions, including their level of implementation, their plans for adoption, the anticipated benefits, and ROI expectations.\n",
      "These surveys are not meant to be a comprehensive or exhaustive view of all healthcare stakeholders, nor do they aim to predict stakeholders’ actions in the future. Instead, the surveys are meant to provide insights into the potential of gen AI and the progress groups have made so far. The most recent survey features responses from 150 stakeholders, of whom 29 percent are C-level executives and 37 percent are from organizations with more than $10 billion in revenue. This survey, conducted over a week in December 2024, includes 60 leaders from payer organizations, 60 from health systems, and 30 from HST groups, with follow-up interviews providing additional insights into adoption strategies and use cases. Previous surveys included 40 leaders from payer organizations, 40 from health systems, and 30 from HST groups, with C-level executives accounting for about 30 percent of each sample and organizations with greater than $10 billion in annual revenue accounting for about 40 percent.\n",
      "This survey targeted 150 US healthcare leaders across subsectors and builds on similar samples of 100 leaders from the first and second quarters of 2024 and the fourth quarter of 2023. From the responses, four distinct themes emerged.\n",
      "Adoption and implementation The majority of respondents to the fourth quarter 2024 survey said their organizations have either implemented gen AI use cases or begun to develop proofs of concept. More respondents were in the implementation stage than in the proof-of-concept stage, which suggests that organizations are successfully advancing their gen AI investments. However, 15 percent of respondents had not yet started to develop proof-of-concept use cases. These respondents’ organizations could fall behind if they build out their capabilities slowly while early adopters progress their capabilities more quickly and realize the impact from their investments. Partnerships and hyperscalers Among respondents who are implementing gen AI, partnerships are the dominant strategy for adoption, with 61 percent saying they intend to pursue partnerships with third-party vendors to develop customized solutions as their primary strategy. In comparison, 20 percent of respondents said they intend to build gen AI capabilities in-house, and 19 percent said they intend to buy off-the-shelf solutions. Of respondents across subsectors choosing to partner, 58 percent are looking to their existing IT solution partners to fill this role, and 46 percent are also exploring partnerships with hyperscalers, driven by these vendors’ expertise in data management. The scope of gen AI Gen AI may create tremendous value in areas that could fundamentally improve patient experience and streamline operations to generate cost savings. Respondents across subsectors said gen AI’s greatest source of potential could be in improving administrative efficiency and clinical productivity. Many respondents also recognize opportunities in patient or member engagement and IT or infrastructure, suggesting a wide breadth of gen AI use cases. Quantifying impact Many of the respondents who said their organizations are progressing to implement gen AI capabilities also said they are looking to quantify the impact of their investments. Of respondents that have already implemented gen AI use cases, 64 percent reported that they anticipated or had already quantified positive ROI, suggesting high expectations for gen AI technology.\n",
      "Stakeholders in the healthcare industry are seeking ways to create value and reduce costs across domains, providing ample opportunity for the use of gen AI. Despite the complexities of evolving regulation, risk compliance, and internal capability gaps, responses from this recent survey suggest that more payers, health systems, and HST organizations are progressing to implement use cases across functions. What’s more, many healthcare leaders are looking to fill the gaps in their capabilities by pursuing partnerships that allow them to bring in outside talent while maintaining flexibility and customization in AI solutions. Partnerships with hyperscalers that have data capabilities could help ensure successful implementations.\n",
      "Respondents’ early use cases with gen AI have focused on improving administrative efficiency, addressing IT and infrastructure gaps, and increasing clinical productivity. As competencies mature, more use cases could become worthwhile, including external engagements with patients or members and quality-of-care use cases, which could further improve patient and member experiences overall. Leaders agree that risk management in implementing AI is important, and considering an AI governance approach will be important to advance these efforts safely.\n",
      "So far, organizations that have developed their capabilities and appropriately targeted their gen AI efforts have had the most success achieving at-scale implementation. The development of gen AI remains important to success in the healthcare space, and leaders can consider how to position their organizations for the future. Successful implementations will require a value-driven strategy, strong delivery capabilities, and robust organizational management.

      "More importantly, there’s a gap in the skills needed to develop strategies for implementing AI from a business value perspective. The role of the chief AI officer (CAIO) has recently been rising to fill these gaps. Regardless, there’s still a significant skills gap in the workforce regarding the understanding and management of AI technologies, according to a 2023 study by GlobalData .\n",
      "Before implementing AI, experts recommend building trust and confidence in AI across all healthcare workforce levels, including providers, IT staff, executives and administrators. Involving existing staff leverages their familiarity with operations, but incorporating external expertise—such as hiring a CAIO or consulting with outsourcing firms—can help navigate implementation challenges effectively.\n",
      "Takeaways\n",
      "The integration of AI into healthcare is met with excitement and caution. Innovative AI applications generate industrywide enthusiasm but encounter challenges like data quality, regulatory hurdles and workforce skepticism. These issues often temper initial optimism, highlighting the complex path to adoption.\n",
      "Despite challenges, the increasing adoption of AI in healthcare suggests a transformative future. With the market expected to reach $188 billion by 2030 , overcoming obstacles with innovation can significantly enhance healthcare quality, efficiency and accessibility, making AI a fundamental improvement rather than a fleeting trend.\n",

      "The impact of AI on modern healthcare systems is a complex and multifaceted topic. According to a recent survey by McKinsey, 85% of healthcare leaders are exploring or have already adopted generative AI capabilities, with the majority of respondents saying their organizations have either implemented gen AI use cases or begun to develop proofs of concept. The survey also found that partnerships are the dominant strategy for adoption, with 61% of respondents saying they intend to pursue partnerships with third-party vendors to develop customized solutions. The scope of gen AI is wide, with respondents recognizing opportunities in improving administrative efficiency, clinical productivity, patient or member engagement, and IT or infrastructure. Many respondents also reported that they are looking to quantify the impact of their investments, with 64% of those who have already implemented gen AI use cases reporting that they anticipated or had already quantified positive ROI. Overall, the survey suggests that gen AI has the potential to create tremendous value in healthcare, but its development and implementation require a value-driven strategy, strong delivery capabilities, and robust organizational management. \n",

      "A study published in 2024 revealed that artificial intelligence (AI) tools can analyze data from individual cells within tumors to forecast whether a patient’s cancer will react to a particular drug. Another study by Google Health showed that their AI model could detect breast cancer from mammogram images with the accuracy of a trained radiologist. Their AI model reduced false positive and false negative rates and outperformed six expert radiologists . However, the researchers noted challenges in the clinical deployment of AI tools, citing issues like integrating it into existing radiology workflows and establishing regulatory approval processes.\n",

      "AI In Healthcare: The Top Five Challenges\n",
      "\n",
      "The case of AI in mammography is an excellent example of how implementing AI in healthcare can improve and streamline patient care, diagnostic procedures and more. However, it also shows that the path to successful AI implementation in healthcare is paved with obstacles. Let’s explore the top five challenges hindering the widespread adoption of AI in the healthcare industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Data Quality And Accessibility\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the biggest stumbling blocks to real-world AI implementation has been a deceptively simple challenge: access to high-quality data. Experts predict that the CAGR of healthcare data will reach 36% by 2025. This massive increase in healthcare data poses great opportunities. At the same time, it introduces significant challenges for health tech companies adopting AI technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The volume of data doesn’t guarantee its quality and availability. Healthcare data is often fragmented across different systems, leading to inaccuracies and inconsistencies. These inaccuracies can adversely affect the performance and reliability of AI models, leading to flawed insights and recommendations. Addressing data quality and accessibility challenges lays the foundation for the transformative potential of AI in healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Implementation Cost\n",
      "\n",
      "Cleveland Clinic has been at the forefront of implementing AI in healthcare and overcoming data quality issues. By successfully implementing AI solutions to analyze patient flow and optimize scheduling, they’ve reduced wait times by 10% .\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, achieving this level of AI integration requires significant investment in technological infrastructure, regulatory compliance, staff training and more. Organizations can mitigate these financial barriers by using trusted, experienced resources that reduce the cost of implementation and avoid wasteful steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the appropriate use of RAG architecture can significantly reduce runtime expenses and increase the performance and quality of the output. Additionally, companies often don’t fully grasp the complexity of working with AI, seeing only the tip of the iceberg and missing the hidden costs. Significant additional investment is required to realize its potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Acceptance Of AI In Healthcare\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the executive level, AI implementation in healthcare affects patients and healthcare professionals in terms of human acceptance and trust issues. A 2023 study found that clinical staff may struggle to accept AI due to the need to learn new skills and take on more complex tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts focus on educational efforts and clear communication to address AI adoption concerns. Introducing AI systems that closely match current human activities—like predictive analytics for patient monitoring and virtual assistants for scheduling—demonstrates AI’s reliability and direct benefits, which may enhance overall acceptance in healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Lack Of Experience In Evaluating AI Performance\n",
      "\n",
      "Without assessing AI systems’ performance, successful implementation is unlikely. This involves examining their integration with existing processes and measuring their accuracy and reliability, user satisfaction and overall impact on business goals. As AI technologies become increasingly integrated into healthcare systems, executives and clinical leaders often lack frameworks for assessing AI’s effectiveness and safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "This gap in experience can lead to challenges in determining how well AI solutions meet clinical goals, integrate with existing health IT systems, impact patient outcomes and affect the company’s financial performance. This challenge underscores the need for comprehensive training programs, partnerships with AI experts and the development of standardized evaluation frameworks to build the necessary expertise in this rapidly evolving field.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Technical Complexity And Skill Gaps\n",
      "\n",
      "Last but not least, developing and deploying AI solutions in healthcare requires specialized technical expertise in machine learning, data science and software engineering. However, there’s a shortage of skilled professionals with the necessary knowledge and experience to design, implement and maintain AI-driven systems in healthcare settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "More importantly, there’s a gap in the skills needed to develop strategies for implementing AI from a business value perspective. The role of the chief AI officer (CAIO) has recently been rising to fill these gaps. Regardless, there’s still a significant skills gap in the workforce regarding the understanding and management of AI technologies, according to a 2023 study by GlobalData .\n",
      "\n",
      "Before implementing AI, experts recommend building trust and confidence in AI across all healthcare workforce levels, including providers, IT staff, executives and administrators. Involving existing staff leverages their familiarity with operations, but incorporating external expertise—such as hiring a CAIO or consulting with outsourcing firms—can help navigate implementation challenges effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Takeaways\n",
      "\n",
      "The integration of AI into healthcare is met with excitement and caution. Innovative AI applications generate industrywide enthusiasm but encounter challenges like data quality, regulatory hurdles and workforce skepticism. These issues often temper initial optimism, highlighting the complex path to adoption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite challenges, the increasing adoption of AI in healthcare suggests a transformative future. With the market expected to reach $188 billion by 2030 , overcoming obstacles with innovation can significantly enhance healthcare quality, efficiency and accessibility, making AI a fundamental improvement rather than a fleeting trend.\n",

      "A study published in 2024 revealed that artificial intelligence (AI) tools can analyze data from individual cells within tumors to forecast whether a patient’s cancer will react to a particular drug. Another study by Google Health showed that their AI model could detect breast cancer from mammogram images with the accuracy of a trained radiologist. Their AI model reduced false positive and false negative rates and outperformed six expert radiologists . However, the researchers noted challenges in the clinical deployment of AI tools, citing issues like integrating it into existing radiology workflows and establishing regulatory approval processes.\n",

      "AI In Healthcare: The Top Five Challenges\n",
      "\n",
      "The case of AI in mammography is an excellent example of how implementing AI in healthcare can improve and streamline patient care, diagnostic procedures and more. However, it also shows that the path to successful AI implementation in healthcare is paved with obstacles. Let’s explore the top five challenges hindering the widespread adoption of AI in the healthcare industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Data Quality And Accessibility\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the biggest stumbling blocks to real-world AI implementation has been a deceptively simple challenge: access to high-quality data. Experts predict that the CAGR of healthcare data will reach 36% by 2025. This massive increase in healthcare data poses great opportunities. At the same time, it introduces significant challenges for health tech companies adopting AI technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The volume of data doesn’t guarantee its quality and availability. Healthcare data is often fragmented across different systems, leading to inaccuracies and inconsistencies. These inaccuracies can adversely affect the performance and reliability of AI models, leading to flawed insights and recommendations. Addressing data quality and accessibility challenges lays the foundation for the transformative potential of AI in healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Implementation Cost\n",
      "\n",
      "Cleveland Clinic has been at the forefront of implementing AI in healthcare and overcoming data quality issues. By successfully implementing AI solutions to analyze patient flow and optimize scheduling, they’ve reduced wait times by 10% .\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, achieving this level of AI integration requires significant investment in technological infrastructure, regulatory compliance, staff training and more. Organizations can mitigate these financial barriers by using trusted, experienced resources that reduce the cost of implementation and avoid wasteful steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the appropriate use of RAG architecture can significantly reduce runtime expenses and increase the performance and quality of the output. Additionally, companies often don’t fully grasp the complexity of working with AI, seeing only the tip of the iceberg and missing the hidden costs. Significant additional investment is required to realize its potential.\n",

      "A study published in 2024 revealed that artificial intelligence (AI) tools can analyze data from individual cells within tumors to forecast whether a patient’s cancer will react to a particular drug. Another study by Google Health showed that their AI model could detect breast cancer from mammogram images with the accuracy of a trained radiologist. Their AI model reduced false positive and false negative rates and outperformed six expert radiologists . However, the researchers noted challenges in the clinical deployment of AI tools, citing issues like integrating it into existing radiology workflows and establishing regulatory approval processes.\n",

      "AI In Healthcare: The Top Five Challenges\n",
      "\n",
      "The case of AI in mammography is an excellent example of how implementing AI in healthcare can improve and streamline patient care, diagnostic procedures and more. However, it also shows that the path to successful AI implementation in healthcare is paved with obstacles. Let’s explore the top five challenges hindering the widespread adoption of AI in the healthcare industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Data Quality And Accessibility\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the biggest stumbling blocks to real-world AI implementation has been a deceptively simple challenge: access to high-quality data. Experts predict that the CAGR of healthcare data will reach 36% by 2025. This massive increase in healthcare data poses great opportunities. At the same time, it introduces significant challenges for health tech companies adopting AI technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The volume of data doesn’t guarantee its quality and availability. Healthcare data is often fragmented across different systems, leading to inaccuracies and inconsistencies. These inaccuracies can adversely affect the performance and reliability of AI models, leading to flawed insights and recommendations. Addressing data quality and accessibility challenges lays the foundation for the transformative potential of AI in healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Implementation Cost\n",
      "\n",
      "Cleveland Clinic has been at the forefront of implementing AI in healthcare and overcoming data quality issues. By successfully implementing AI solutions to analyze patient flow and optimize scheduling, they’ve reduced wait times by 10% .\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, achieving this level of AI integration requires significant investment in technological infrastructure, regulatory compliance, staff training and more. Organizations can mitigate these financial barriers by using trusted, experienced resources that reduce the cost of implementation and avoid wasteful steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the appropriate use of RAG architecture can significantly reduce runtime expenses and increase the performance and quality of the output. Additionally, companies often don’t fully grasp the complexity of working with AI, seeing only the tip of the iceberg and missing the hidden costs. Significant additional investment is required to realize its potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Acceptance Of AI In Healthcare\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the executive level, AI implementation in healthcare affects patients and healthcare professionals in terms of human acceptance and trust issues. A 2023 study found that clinical staff may struggle to accept AI due to the need to learn new skills and take on more complex tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts focus on educational efforts and clear communication to address AI adoption concerns. Introducing AI systems that closely match current human activities—like predictive analytics for patient monitoring and virtual assistants for scheduling—demonstrates AI’s reliability and direct benefits, which may enhance overall acceptance in healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Lack Of Experience In Evaluating AI Performance\n",
      "\n",
      "Without assessing AI systems’ performance, successful implementation is unlikely. This involves examining their integration with existing processes and measuring their accuracy and reliability, user satisfaction and overall impact on business goals. As AI technologies become increasingly integrated into healthcare systems, executives and clinical leaders often lack frameworks for assessing AI’s effectiveness and safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "This gap in experience can lead to challenges in determining how well AI solutions meet clinical goals, integrate with existing health IT systems, impact patient outcomes and affect the company’s financial performance. This challenge underscores the need for comprehensive training programs, partnerships with AI experts and the development of standardized evaluation frameworks to build the necessary expertise in this rapidly evolving field.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Technical Complexity And Skill Gaps\n",
      "\n",
      "Last but not least, developing and deploying AI solutions in healthcare requires specialized technical expertise in machine learning, data science and software engineering. However, there’s a shortage of skilled professionals with the necessary knowledge and experience to design, implement and maintain AI-driven systems in healthcare settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "More importantly, there’s a gap in the skills needed to develop strategies for implementing AI from a business value perspective. The role of the chief AI officer (CAIO) has\u001b[00m\n",
